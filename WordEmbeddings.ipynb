    "Right at the top of the list we see the word <i>kettle</i>. This may refer to the method by which healthier versions of chips are cooked. However, I think it's more likely that it refers to the brand Kettle Foods, which according to wikipedia is the largest natural potato chip brand in the USA.

Apparently, consumers have come to feel similarly as the algorithm learned from the reviews to create a word vector for <i>popchips</i> that is more similar to $v_{chips} - v_{fat}$ then almost any other word vector.<br><br>\n",
    "In addition to particular brands selling healthier versions of chips, we see other words that suggest to us what kind of healthier alternatives to chips consumers may be interested in. For example, we see the word <i>pickles</i>. Like chips, pickles are a crunchy, salty snack, but they certainly have less fat than chips, so it's reasonable that the word <i>pickles</i> appeared on the list. Perhaps health-conscious consumers enjoy pickles as a substitute for chips.\n",
    "We also see the words <i>tortilla</i> and <i>multigrain</i>. The word <i>tortilla</i> appears perhaps because tortilla chips do in fact generally contain less fat than potato chips, and consumers have recognized them as a healthy type of chip.

    "Word embeddings are a powerful tool, but perhaps they need to be combined with other techniques to meet their full potential. In doing this project, I found that it would be beneficial to somehow automate the creation of lists of words of interest. For example, it could be interesting to create a visualization of the word vectors associated to the names of all of the different brands of foods mentioned in the reviews. In the future, I am going to use Named Entity Recogniton techniques to try to extract the names of different brands.<br><br>\n",
